# VideoPress Player API Documentation

This is documentation for the public VideoPress player API. It describes how you can interface with the player to implement custom behaviour or introduce interactivity with your WordPress site.

There are 2 apis that are currently supported:
1. [The VideoPress Player iframe/js api](public-js-api.md) - our latest and most up to date interface for the VideoPress player.
2. [The VideoPress PostMessage api](postmessage.md) - our legacy PostMessage api which is not as featureful as the iframe/js api.

### Let us know

If there is a feature you would like to see in the api, or if you've found an issue with the api let us know in a new GitHub Issue!

### Coming Soon

We will also be providing some helpful information for plugin and theme developers to better integrate the VideoPress player
